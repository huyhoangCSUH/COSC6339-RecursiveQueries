This is the code to generate SQL Recursive Queries for HP Vertica database.
It has been simplified to serve the purpose of the class, so there are many hard-coded parameters in many places.

The code has been compiled for java 7 and can be run as-is after changing the parameters in the java.ini file, and you already have database named webgoogle inside Vertica.
To run the program, clone the whole directory onto your Ubuntu machine with Vertica, and type:

java RQ_CALL 

To make it run with your table, modify the hard-coded parameters in RQ_CALL.java's main function then reompile.
The txt filename should be changed accordingly, with the format: tableName and recursive_depth and the phrases "_groupopt.txt".
